最大積載量は`[max(weights), sum(weights)]`のどれかになる。二分探索で試していくと良い。計算量はO(nlogn)になる。
上限はちゃんと考えればもう少し低くできそうな気もするが、二分探索をするなら効果としては薄い。

1st


```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        def calc_day_to_ship(max_capacity):
            day = 1
            current = 0
            for weight in weights:
                if current + weight > max_capacity:
                    day += 1
                    current = 0
                current += weight
            return day

        low = max(weights)
        high = sum(weights)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            day = calc_day_to_ship(mid)
            if day <= days:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return low
```

2nd

shipできるかまでを関数に切り出し
```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        def can_ship(max_capacity):
            day = 1
            capacity = 0
            for weight in weights:
                capacity += weight
                if capacity > max_capacity:
                    day += 1
                    capacity = weight
            return day <= days
        
        low = max(weights)
        high = sum(weights)

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if can_ship(mid):
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return low
```


3rd

2ndと同じ。
```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        def can_ship(max_capacity):
            day = 1
            capacity = 0
            for weight in weights:
                capacity += weight
                if capacity > max_capacity:
                    day += 1
                    capacity = weight
            return day <= days

        low = max(weights)
        high = sum(weights)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if can_ship(mid):
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return low
```

4th
命名を変えた程度。

```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        def can_ship(max_capacity):
            needed_days = 1
            current_weight = 0
            for weight in weights:
                current_weight += weight
                if current_weight > max_capacity:
                    current_weight = weight
                    needed_days += 1
            return needed_days <= days

        low = max(weights)
        high = sum(weights)
        while low < high:
            middle = (low + high) // 2
            if can_ship(middle):
                high = middle
            else:
                low = middle + 1
        return low
```

5th

can_shipのfor文の中をif-elseに

```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        def can_ship(capacity):
            needed_days =  1
            current = 0
            for weight in weights:
                if current + weight <= capacity:
                    current += weight
                else:
                    needed_days += 1
                    current = weight
            return needed_days <= days

        low = max(weights)
        high = sum(weights)

        while low < high:
            middle = (low + high) // 2
            if can_ship(middle):
                high = middle
            else:
                low = middle + 1
        return low
```
