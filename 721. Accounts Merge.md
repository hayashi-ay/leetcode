## 概要

>Given a list of `accounts` where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are **emails** representing emails of the account.
>
>Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
>
>After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails **in sorted order**. The accounts themselves can be returned in **any order**.

## 方針
### Intuition

### DFS
Time Complexity: $O(nk\ log\ nk))$
Space Complexity: $O(nk)$
Where: `n = len(accounts), m = max(len(accounts[i]) for i in range(len(accounts)))`

```python
def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
	def visit_connected_emails(current_email, connected_emails):
		if current_email in visited_emails:
			return
		visited_emails.add(current_email)
		connected_emails.append(current_email)
		for next_email in email_connections[current_email]:
			visit_connected_emails(next_email, connected_emails)

	email_connections = defaultdict(list)
	for account in accounts:
		first_email = account[1]
		for other_email in account[2:]:
			email_connections[first_email].append(other_email)
			email_connections[other_email].append(first_email)

	merged_accounts = []
	visited_emails = set()
	for account in accounts:
		account_name = account[0]
		first_email = account[1]
		# this account is already merged
		if first_email in visited_emails:
			continue
		connected_emails = []
		visit_connected_emails(first_email, connected_emails)
		merged_account = [account_name] + sorted(connected_emails)
		merged_accounts.append(merged_account)
	return merged_accounts
```
### Union Find
Time Complexity: $O(nk\ log\ nk))$
Space Complexity: $O(nk)$
Where: `n = len(accounts), m = max(len(accounts[i]) for i in range(len(accounts)))`

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.groups = [i for i in range(size)]
    
    def find(self, group_idx):
        if self.groups[group_idx] != group_idx:
            self.groups[group_idx] = self.find(self.groups[group_idx])
        return self.groups[group_idx]
    
    def union(self, dst_idx, src_idx):
        dst_group_idx = self.find(dst_idx)
        src_group_idx = self.find(src_idx)
        self.groups[src_group_idx] = dst_group_idx

class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        groups = UnionFind(len(accounts))
        email_account_map = {} # email: account_idx

        for idx in range(len(accounts)):
            for email in accounts[idx][1:]:
                if email in email_account_map:
                    merged_account_idx = email_account_map[email]
                    groups.union(merged_account_idx, idx)
                else:
                    email_account_map[email] = idx
        
        merged_emails = defaultdict(list)
        for email, account_idx in email_account_map.items():
            merged_account_idx = groups.find(account_idx)
            merged_emails[merged_account_idx].append(email)
        
        ans = []
        for account_idx, emails in merged_emails.items():
            account_name = accounts[account_idx][0]
            merged_account = [account_name] + sorted(emails)
            ans.append(merged_account)
        return ans
```
